# Time Table Parser
[**This Site**](https://tscburak.github.io/TimeTableParser/) was built using [_GitHub Pages_](https://pages.github.com/).

## Description
The parser generates a less confusing exam chart. The user can export it as PDF/XLSX or print it.

## How it Works?
1) First the user has to import the PDF. (PDF must be issued by UU MDBF)
2) Then the user needs to choose the year that he/she wants to create for. (e.g. 1st year)
3) User can provide the start date of the exam week. It is optional. If the user does not choose any date, it takes the start date of the spring semester final exam (20/06/2022).
4) That's it! The user can delete an exam on the table if it needs. 
> We need the start date of the exam week because the original chart does not show the dates. It shows days only. We need to define the date with the days to make it easier to understand.
